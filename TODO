1) create df with [ names, pd_coord, fc_coord]
so calculations can be done with pd_coord, while plotting on fc_coord:
2) 2D square for quaternary phase fields - add check of this spacial case, when this plot appears 
3) In results, print [formula, reduced(normalized) formula and its coeffiecients, ... energy]
